# Death Certificate Classification Fix - Implementation Complete

## Problem
The system was incorrectly classifying death certificate files as funeral invoices, causing user confusion and potential data processing errors.

## Solution
We implemented a comprehensive fix by:

1. **Enhanced AI Agent Adapter**
   - Improved document type detection using a multi-signal approach
   - Enhanced filename parsing to handle underscores and special characters
   - Added support for "cert" as an alternative to "certificate"
   - Prioritized explicit filename patterns to ensure reliable classification
   - Lowered the threshold for initial document classification

2. **Frontend Refactoring**
   - Modified FormPage.js to rely on backend-determined document types
   - Created a mapping system to translate document types to UI evidence types
   - Removed redundant document type classification in frontend code
   - Added fallback mechanisms to recover documents when needed

3. **Architectural Improvements**
   - Centralized document classification logic in the backend
   - Followed single responsibility principle with backend handling classification
   - Improved error handling for document processing failures
   - Added comprehensive logging for better diagnostics

## Testing Results
- Death certificate files now consistently classify as "Death Certificate"
- Funeral invoice files correctly classify as "Funeral Invoice"
- Benefit letters properly classify as "Benefit Letter" 
- Proof of relationship documents correctly identify as "Proof of Relationship"

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider expanding the document type detection system to handle more document types
2. Add more context-aware classification using document content analysis
3. Implement a feedback loop for continuously improving classification accuracy
