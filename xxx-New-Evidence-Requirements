## FEP Application Form Requirements

1. **Data Persistence**
   - The application form must persist data to a MongoDB database
   - Each form should be stored as a document in an "applicationForms" collection

2. **Application Identification**
   - Each application form must have a unique identifier (`applicationId`)
   - The application ID must be a UUID v4 format
   - Example: `"applicationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`

3. **User Association**
   - Each application form must be associated with a specific user via their `customerId`
   - The customerId must be stored with the application form document
   

4. **Application Status Management**
   - Applications must have a status field with the following possible values:
     - "draft": Initial state, editable by the user
     - "submitted": Final state, no longer editable by the user
   - Status transitions must be logged with timestamps
   - Example: `"status": "draft", "statusHistory": [{"status": "draft", "timestamp": "2025-07-19T10:30:00Z"}]`

5. **Draft Management**
   - The system must allow users to save forms as drafts
   - Draft forms must be retrievable when users log back in
   - Each page of the form must be independently saveable
   - Draft data must be loaded automatically when a user returns to a previously saved page

6. **Form Submission**
   - Upon submission, the application status must be updated to "submitted"
   - A submission timestamp must be recorded
   - A confirmation receipt should be generated and provided to the user
   - Example: `"status": "submitted", "submissionTimestamp": "2025-07-19T14:45:00Z"`

## Evidence Upload Requirements

2. **Multi-file Selection**
   - Users must be able to select multiple files for upload in a single operation
   - The UI must provide clear feedback on selected files
   - The UI must display progress during the upload process for the specifc file being uploaded.
   - There must be on estatus box, not stacked status boxes as there is currentl as this looks messy

3. **Upload Processing Workflow**
   - For each selected file, the system must process files seuentially, not all at once:
     - **Duplicate Check**: Verify the filename doesn't already exist for this application
     - **Upload**: If not a duplicate, upload and associate with the current draft application and person
     - **Record**: Add the filename to the evidence structure of the application model
     - **Text Extraction**: Extract text from the image using OCR
     - **Classification**: Identify document type (birth certificate, death certificate, etc.)
     - **Field Matching**: Match extracted data to application form fields
     - **Data Population**: Pre-fill matched data into the application form data model

4. **Evidence Data Model**
   - Each piece of evidence must be stored, linked to current application and person with the following example information:
   ```json
   {
     "evidenceId": "ev-550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
     "filename": "birth_certificate.jpg",
     "uploadTimestamp": "2025-07-19T11:30:00Z",
     "documentType": "Birth Certificate",
     "extractedText": "...",
     "matchedFields": [
       {
         "formField": "dateOfBirth",
         "extractedValue": "1980-01-15",
         "confidenceScore": 0.95
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Evidence Viewing Requirements

1. **Evidence List View**
   - On entering the evidence upload page, the system must display all evidence bound to the current application
   - The list must include:
     - Filename
     - Upload date
     - Document type (if identified)

2. **Evidence Deletion**
   - Users must be able to delete previously uploaded evidence
   - Deletion process:
     - Remove the evidence file from storage
     - Remove the evidence entry from the application model
     - Maintain, do not delete, any form data that was populated from the evidence
   - Confirmation dialog must be displayed before deletion

3. **Evidence Detail View**
   - Users should be able to view details of uploaded evidence including:
     - Preview of the document (if image format)
     - Extracted data
     - Fields populated from this evidence
