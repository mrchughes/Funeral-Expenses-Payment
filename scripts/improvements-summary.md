# Data Extraction Improvements Summary

## Key Improvements Implemented

1. **Context-Aware Extraction**
   - Added deceased and applicant name fields to provide context to AI
   - Modified API to pass context data to extraction process
   - Enhanced document classifier to use context for better field mapping

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - Removed document type checkboxes for simpler user experience
   - Added deceased name field at the top of the evidence page
   - Added applicant name field for additional context
   - Added explanatory text about how names improve extraction

3. **Backend Enhancements**
   - Improved AI prompt to leverage context information
   - Enhanced document classifier with context-aware field mapping
   - Added field normalization for better form field matching
   - Added document type classification based on content and filename

## Test Results

- ✅ Document classification works correctly
- ✅ Field normalization properly maps fields
- ✅ Context enhancement adds fields based on context
- ✅ API extraction successfully processes files with context
- ✅ Extraction with context shows improved results

## Verification

We can verify the improvements by comparing the extraction results with and without context:

**Without Context:**
```json
{
  "deceasedFirstName": { "value": "Brian" },
  "deceasedLastName": { "value": "Hughes" },
  ...
}
```

**With Context:**
```json
{
  "deceasedFirstName": { "value": "Brian" },
  "deceasedLastName": { "value": "Hughes" },
  "applicantName": { "value": "Sarah Hughes" },
  ...
}
```

The extraction with context includes additional fields that improve the form filling experience.
