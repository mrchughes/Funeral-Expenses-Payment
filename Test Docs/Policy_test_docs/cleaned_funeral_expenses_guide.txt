Welsh Language preference
If a customer requests that they wish to speak in Welsh – refer to Bereavement Service - Welsh Language process  and check Language Preference before sending any correspondence.
Vulnerable customers
Treat a claimant or customer as vulnerable where they have complex needs and or requires additional support to enable them to access DWP benefits and use our services.
Alternative formats
Any additional claimant needs which have previously been identified will be held on the Customer Information System (CIS). This is accessed through Searchlight. The system can be accessed by all areas and can record multiple additional needs.
You must check the system during each contact with the claimant, to see if reasonable adjustments or alternative formats are requested.
This allows claimants with accessibility needs to access services effectively and the need to tell DWP once, which minimises claimant contact and possible distress.
Request for an alternative format letter
When a claimant requests an alternative format letter, you must:
Complete a decision on the Social Fund Computer System (SFCS):
complete dialogue 50 with the claimant or funeral director's information and the requested amounts
in dialogue 183, process award as usual
add note to dialogue 30 in SFCS and Customer Account Management system (CAM) Lite that a letter has been issued clerically due to claimant specific needs. Include that this has been sent to an alternative format (Single Point of Contact) SPOC for processing.
Telephone claimant to advise they will receive two award letters, one will be system generated and the other will be in their chosen format.
Complete a clerical decision letter. Do not issue this to the customer. Access these in the customer content portal (CCP). Upload the clerical decision letter to the customer’s account in Document Repository System (DRS).
Email Newcastle Pension(link sends e-mail) (link sends an email) and attach the letter which must be converted to an alternative format. Include the following in the body of the email:
claimant’s name
National Insurance number
server number
format which is requested.
The action will be taken from the email request and the letter will be converted into the appropriate format and sent to the customer.
You will receive an email which confirms that the request has been actioned. Once this arrives you must upload a copy of the print request to claimant's CAMLite record.
More details can be found in the Vulnerability Instructions.

The date of a Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) claim is the date of receipt of the SF200 adult or child claim form or the date the telephone claim taken by the Bereavement Service is complete.
If the claim is not complete, the original date of receipt may still be the date of claim if:
form SF200 adult or child is:
issued or returned for completion, and
properly completed and returned within one calendar month of issue,
details to complete the telephone claim or the SF200 are received within one calendar month of being requested

Children’s Funeral Fund (CFF) scheme was launched on 23 July 2019 and is administered by The Ministry of Justice (MoJ). For further information, see: Support for child funeral costs (Children’s Funeral Fund for England)(link is external).
CFF includes provision for burial/cremation costs, and a contribution of up to £300 towards the cost of a coffin. It applies to child funerals in England only, as Wales and Scotland have their own schemes.
CFF is not means tested, and applies to young people under 18 and stillbirths from 24 weeks. It does not cover travel costs.
Take the following action on any valid FEP claim:
for a child meeting the CFF definition of a child
and when the funeral has taken place on or after 23 July 2019.
Check eligibility to FEP.
If eligible, check if the claim includes anything that could be claimed under CFF. If nothing included in the claim that can be claimed under CFF, continue business as usual under normal FEP rules.
If something is included in the claim that could be claimed under CFF:
contact MoJ using the  DWP-MoJ-Child Funeral  template to confirm if a claim has been made and paid
MoJ will return the template within 48 hours, if the form is not returned contact MoJ on the dedicated number to escalate.
if MoJ advise their case has been referred to a DM for a decision, BF the case for 5 days. MoJ aim to respond within 5 days. If there is no response, contact MoJ again for the outcome of their decision.
if MoJ advise there is no claim to CFF, go to step 5.
if MoJ advise a claim has been made and paid to CFF, go to step 6.
If no claim has been made to CFF:
allow claim under FEP rules for necessary or additional costs
prioritise FEP additional costs, then consider other CFF costs
advise MoJ of the amount paid for CFF costs using the DWP-MoJ-Child Funeral Template
Contact claimant to advise that we haven't paid for that could be recovered by CFF and signpost to CFF advising that CFF usually claimed for by the burial or cremation authority or the Funeral Director
update 204 with details of contact with MoJ.
If a claim has been made to CFF:
allow FEP claim for any non CFF costs
include amount over £300 for coffin cost if the £300 was covered by CFF
pay any FEP necessary costs not covered by the CFF costs
update 204 with details of contact with MoJ.

England and Wales
There are no changes to the application process for Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) for claimants who reside in England or Wales.
Scotland
From 16 September 2019 the Funeral Support Payment (FSP) replaced FEP for claimants who reside in Scotland. FSP is administered by the Scottish Government (SG). For further information on FSP, see: Access to public services in Scotland(link is external).
FEP is no longer available for claimants who:
reside in Scotland, or
whose correspondence address is in Scotland after 16 September 2019.
The claimant will have a correspondence address when they are either No Fixed Abode (NFA) or a Person without Accommodation (PWA).
Where the claimant is NFA or PWA, and has provided a Scottish correspondence address, further details will be required from the SPOC to establish where they reside.
Take the following action on any valid, signed FEP claim submitted on or after 16 September 2019:
When FEP claims are registered on SFCS, users will receive the error message E4361 if a claim is for a Scottish or Scottish Border post code.
If no error message is received, go to step 2.
If the error message E4361 is received, transfer the claim to the Decision Maker (DM) dealing with claims from Scottish residents, then go to step 3.
If the Warning Message W9761 is received for a claimant who has a Scottish or Scottish border post code, with NFA or PWA; transfer the claim to the DM dealing with claims from Scottish residents. The DM must contact the SPOC for further details to establish where they reside.
Postcode in England or Wales
The claimant will be entitled to a FEP, subject to the eligibility and qualifying benefit conditions:
access CIS to confirm if there is a FSP interest recorded.
If no FSP interest recorded continue business as usual process for FEP.
If FSP interest recorded:
contact Social Security Scotland (SSS) on the dedicated Scottish Government telephone line and email exchange to take place between DWP and SG processors to confirm identity from their respective GOV.UK email addresses
ask SG processor if a claim has been made to FSP and check if the claim relates to same deceased person.
if claim is not for the same deceased, continue business as usual decision process for FEP
if claim relates to the same deceased person and the decision is outstanding – BF for 10 working days and await contact from SSS. IF no contact on BF contact SSS
if claim relates to the same deceased person and the FSP has been awarded:
disallow the claim using the decision reason ‘award already made for the deceased’. Complete SF204 and A6 with Nil Award decision. On SF204 part 3 enter ‘Y’ at part ‘has award already been made for this funeral’

Where the claimant has indicated on the FEP claim form that they have applied for a qualifying benefit (QB) and they are waiting for the decision, if the QB is:
administered by the Department for Work and Pensions, do not make the FEP decision until the QB claim has been decided, or
not administered but the Department for example, Tax Credits or HB and or there is a substantial delay in processing the QB, you may disallow the FEP and advise the claimant to reclaim if the QB claim is successful
A claimant is not entitled to a FEP if they or their partner do not have an award of a QB at the date of claim. However, they may be entitled to a FEP if they are subsequently awarded a QB and re-apply for a FEP. Revision of the original decision is also an option if the QB award is backdated to, or before, the date of the original FEP claim.

To confirm UC as a qualifying benefit for FEP, take the following action:
Access Searchlight:
enter the claimant’s NINO
confirm the claimant
check the UC award start date or interest date for new claims
check the UC Assessment Period (AP).
UC is paid monthly in arrears and is reviewed monthly at the end of every AP.
A new UC claim is not decided until the end of the AP. The first AP must therefore have passed before an award of UC can be confirmed as a qualifying benefit.
The claimant must have been in receipt of UC at the end of the last AP. The decision must be made based on the information known at the time the claim is being processed.
When checking the UC AP on Searchlight, take the following action, if the:
initial UC award date is more than one month ago and no end date is recorded go to step 2
initial UC award date is less than one month ago, go to step 3
if the UC award is live but payment amount is nil go to step 4
UC award has ended; UC cannot be accepted as a qualifying benefit.
Where the award of UC started more than 1 month ago and there is no award end date recorded in Searchlight, the first AP has passed:
check UC was awarded and was not nil payment at the end of the last assessment period
accept UC as a qualifying benefit
consider FEP award dependant on data gather of remaining evidence to determine entitlement
take screen print of Searchlight to upload and link with the claim.
Where UC was claimed less than one month ago, there will be an interest date recorded in Searchlight, the first assessment period has not passed.
check the start interest date of UC in Searchlight
set a BF date for one month plus 3 days from that date (the extra days will allow time for the UC award time to be updated)
continue to gather remaining evidence to determine entitlement.
On BF:
check Searchlight as per step 1
if a UC award has been made and no UC award end date, continue as per step 2.
If there is no UC award for example UC interest end date in Searchlight - UC cannot be accepted as a qualifying benefit.
Where the award is live and the payment is NIL:
contact your UC SPOC to confirm reason for nil payment
if nil due to earnings – not entitled to UC
if nil due to suspension – not entitled to UC
if nil due to sanction – entitled to UC
if nil due to UC making housing element payment to Local Authority – entitled to UC
if nil due to Carers Allowance or Carer Support Payment run on, BF case to end of run on and treat as an advance claim.

Tax Credit information is restricted to those staff with a business need. Tax Credit Guidance – Access to Tax Credits Information via CIS Searchlight out how to obtain this access.
If the claimant is in receipt of middle or higher rate DLA assume that the disability premium is being paid. Where it is unclear as to whether or not the premium is being paid, ring HMRC Helpline.
To confirm that the claimant or their partner has been awarded, access CIS Searchlight to check the current payment rate. CIS Searchlight will confirm the Child Tax Credit (CTC) award start date, amount and whether the award includes a disability element.
To confirm the CTC award, take the following action:
Access CIS Searchlight:
Enter the claimant’s NINo
Confirm the claimant
Access Award History
Access CT Credit award details for the relevant period.
Where there is an award in payment and relevant start date:
this can be accepted as verification that the claimant or their partner have been awarded a QB in respect of the date of claim if the start date is on or before the date of the FEP claim
take a screen print.
This should be done on the date the claim is received. If this is not possible, and the start date is after the date of claim, verify the start date of CTC on CIS Searchlight to confirm that the QB condition was satisfied in respect of the date of the FEP claim.
Where there are no award details:
it does not necessarily mean that the claimant or partner had not been awarded CTC in respect of the date of claim
offices should telephone the HMRC Tax Credit Helpline to establish if the claimant or partner:
has had their CTC reduced
is being paid a reduced amount of CTC following an overpayment
has qualifying conditions for CTC (if there was no overpayment) or
qualifies for CTC in respect of the date of claim to the SF.
If you or the claimant need to contact HMRC to check the status of a tax credit claim, the contact numbers are as follows:
For claimant use:
0345 300 3900 for England, Scotland and Wales
0345 603 2000 for Northern Ireland
0300 322 7004 for staff enquiries.

Searchlight
Access Searchlight to confirm if the claimant or their partner has Housing Benefit (HB) in payment.
If the claimant or their partner has a relatively new claim to HB this may not show in Searchlight, therefore follow the guide below.
Contacting Local Authority by telephone
If the claimant has not submitted evidence of the HB award take the following action:
Contact the Local Authority (LA) by telephone to confirm:
that the claimant (or their partner) have been awarded HB, and
the date from which the HB award has been made.
The HB award must be in respect of the date of the Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) claim for this to be a Qualifying Benefit (QB).
Record details of the HB award and upload to the Document Repository System (DRS).
If LA has not provided a telephone contact number or refuses to provide details over the telephone, take the action as instructed in the Contacting the Local Authority by email section below.
Contacting the Local Authority by email
Where the LA refuses to provide HB information in response to a telephone call or requires such requests to be made in writing, take the following action:
Complete SFF001 available in the Customer Contact Portal (CCP) with the HB claimant’s details and attach this to an email. Email the SF001 to the relevant Local Authority and cc in BALHAMIRENEHOUSE.FPADMIN@DWP.GOV.UK (link sends e-mail)
Set a BF for 10 days to check for a reply.
If no reply has been received from the LA after the 10 days, the Decision Maker must email a copy of the original request that was sent to the LA with the proforma to their team leader and ask them to escalate it. The team leader will then send an email to the appropriate LA section(link sends e-mail).
The template below can be used to populate the email.
To ensure that the information is secure, the email must only be sent to an email address within DWP trusted partners list.
Record details of the HB award in SF Dialogue 030 Maintaining Customer Notes and on form A6 if the response is by telephone.
If information on the award of HB is not held on Searchlight, where the claimant submits written confirmation of a current award of HB and this award has been made in respect of the date of the claim, this can be accepted as verification that there is an award of a QB.
If the claimant submits evidence of the HB award and the FEP claim is in respect of the death of their partner, then the award letter needs to be dated on or after the date of death in order to be accepted as evidence for QB purposes as their award may be reviewed as a result of their change of circumstances.
If the claim is in respect of anyone else, then a HB award letter which covers the date of claim is sufficient.
Local Authorities issue letters each April when the rates of HB change.

Before a Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) can be awarded, the claimant or their partner must have accepted responsibility for the funeral expenses.
To have accepted responsibility for the funeral expenses, the claimant or their partner does not have to arrange the funeral as long as they have a written contractual liability with:
the Funeral Director, or
the person who arranges the funeral.
A fully itemised final written bill or signed contract bearing the claimant or partner’s name can be accepted as proof that they have taken responsibility for the funeral expenses.
If an agent acting on behalf of the claimant or their partner arranges the funeral with prior agreement, and there is sufficient evidence to support this, it can be accepted as proof that the claimant or their partner are legally liable for the costs, even if their name does not appear on the funeral bill.
It is not acceptable as proof that the claimant or their partner has accepted responsibility if they:
present an estimate for the funeral bill, and or
accept a moral obligation to meet the funeral expenses.
Estimates and or the acceptance of a moral obligation do not constitute:
the entering into a contract, or
acceptance of contractual liability for the funeral expenses.
Legal transfer of a contract
Where the claimant was not originally responsible for arranging the funeral but now wants to take over responsibility from the person who was, the contract with the Funeral Director can be legally transferred.
Novation
The legal transfer of a contract from one party to another is known as “novation” (go to Novation, chapter 39 of DMG Social Fund Payments.
Novation cannot take place if the contract has been completed.
A contract is deemed to be completed when:
all contracted items and services have been provided, and
there is full and final settlement of the contract.
If the contract is to be replaced obtain evidence that the:
person who entered into the original contract is released from contractual liability, and
person who has taken over the contract has accepted contractual liability59. This evidence could be obtained from either party or the Funeral Director.
The new contract does not have to be identical to the original contract.
Reasonable to accept responsibility
A FEP can be made to a surviving partner, an immediate or close relative or a close friend. It is automatically deemed reasonable for the claimant or their partner to have accepted responsibility for the funeral expenses if:
they are the surviving partner of the deceased, or
the deceased is a child and they are the person responsible for the child for Child Benefit purposes and there is:
no absent parent, or
an absent parent who was awarded a QB as at the date of death, or
the deceased is a still-born child and they are the parent of that child or the partner of the parent as at the date of the stillbirth.
In all other cases, the Decision Maker must determine whether it is reasonable for the claimant or their partner to accept responsibility. For further information, see: DMG Volume 7  Chapter 39, Responsible person and DMG Volume 7 Chapter 39, Reasonable to accept responsibility.
The person responsible for paying the funeral expenses or some other person may also apply for a budgeting loan to help with funeral expenses and this can be:
in addition to a FEP either paid to a responsible person or some other claimant
instead of a FEP, for example where the budgeting loan applicant would not qualify for a FEP.
Budgeting loans
A Budgeting Loan application for help with funeral expenses should be considered separately and is not dependent on a claim for a FEP being made, awarded or refused.
BL procedures are provided in SF Procedural Guidance Part 3 Budgeting Loan Applications(link is external).

Although it is paid as a single sum, a Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) is made up of one or more components, which cover the funeral expenses that the claimant has claimed for.
The costs of the following are allowable funeral expenses:

the necessary fees levied by a private gravedigger
the fees levied in respect of a cremation by the authority or person responsible for the provision and maintenance of crematoria for the area where the cremation takes place in so far as it is necessary to incur those fees, and
in respect of the above, the cost of any medical references
the cost of any necessary registered medical practitioner’s certificates
the fee payable for the removal of an active implant by a registered medical practitioner
if a Funeral Director includes the cost of removal on his bill it should be accepted
the fee payable for the removal of an active implant if it is removed by someone who is not a medical practitioner:
award no more than £20 or
arrange, or
attend the funeral
in the case of a cremation:
the cost of obtaining any documentation, for example the death certificate, the production of which will result in the release of assets of the deceased person which may be deducted from the FEP
when it is necessary, the reasonable cost of transporting the deceased within the United Kingdom (UK) in excess of 50 miles to the Funeral Director’s premises or place of rest
the cost of transport, by a vehicle for the coffin and bearers and one other vehicle from the Funeral Director’s premises or place of rest to the funeral, and that transportation:
the reasonable expenses of one return journey within the UK for the responsible person to:
any other funeral expenses which shall not exceed £700 where the deceased died on or before 7 April 2020 or £1000 where the deceased died on or after 8 April 2020, or if a pre-paid funeral plan exists expenses not exceeding £120.

The Decision Maker (DM) should support the Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) decision with evidence where the law states that the expenses allowed for specified items and services should be necessary and reasonable. See DMG Volume 7 Chapter 39, Reasonable and necessary costs.
The DM can accept the costs as reasonable and necessary in the location of the cremation or burial unless the amount exceeds the amounts in the Geographical area, cremation or burial table.
If it does exceed the amount, the DM should go to: In assessing the costs, to check prices in local area.
Take the following action to establish reasonable and necessary costs:
Check form SF200 adult or SF200 child and the supporting documents to identify what items have been claimed for.
If a fully itemised signed contract or final bill is provided with the claim or has been received and linked with the claim, check the items claimed match those on the contract or final bill.
If there is no signed contract or final bill, follow the instructions for contacting the Funeral Director (FD) to request the signed contract or final bill, go to: Requesting the signed contract or final bill from the Funeral Director. When it is received check the items claimed match those on the contract or bill.
If the contract or final bill has not fully been itemised, for example because the arrangement was a Cremation without Ceremony, allow the costs up to the amounts set out at step 4 and consider any other funeral expenses.
Do not contact the FD or claimant to obtain a breakdown of costs if it is a Cremation without Ceremony (Direct Cremation).
Calculate and apply discount if appropriate.
This refers to costs for cremation or burial fees. Follow the usual process to allow or disallow other specified costs. For example, medical fees, death certificates required to release funds or necessary travel. Do not compare the amounts claimed by the claimant with information on Google Maps and local funeral costs. If the amount is the same or under the amount as set out in the table below, accept the amount claimed as reasonable and necessary.
Geographical area, cremation and burial table  - amounts applicable before 29 July 2024

What this means is that if the customer has incurred costs above those set out in the table above, you must consider if it was reasonable to incur those costs. Have they used their Local Authority (LA) or have they travelled outside of the LA area etc.
If you feel that the incurred costs are reasonable you can award the necessary costs.
If you feel that the incurred costs are not reasonable, you must restrict to a cheaper alternative, documenting your reasons on the A6.
You must not restrict the costs to those set out in the table above.
For the SF200 Child, continue with action outlined at: Children’s Funeral Fund launch on 23 July 2019.
Continue to assess other funeral expenses as outlined in Assessing other funeral expenses.
In assessing the costs
In assessing the costs the DM must:
gather the evidence by making enquiries in the local area of the range of costs of specified items and services
analyse the information collected and decide the necessary and reasonable allowable costs for the area
record the information and analysis to support the decision
periodically check that the information still reflects current prices.
To enable the DM to decide whether costs are necessary and reasonable, each LA should hold information on local funeral costs for:
plot costs
burial costs
cremation fees, and
Funeral Directors' transport costs over 50 miles.
If information is required on funeral costs in another LA , contact the office which covers that area.
Additionally, there are two main national organisations representing the majority of FDs from which information may be sought, the:
National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD), and
Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors (SAIF).

Mr A dies in his home area (Area 1). He wants to be buried in the same plot as his late wife, which can be included in a 're-claimed burial plot' (see DMG, volume 7, chapter 39). That plot is in Area 2 which is 35 miles from the Funeral Director’s premises.
The return journey in the above example will be 70 miles. The Funeral Director charges £3 per mile. The Funeral Expenses Payment claim included £60 for transportation over 50 miles.
It is not necessary for Mr A to be buried with his late wife, however:
the cost of a plot, whether or not that right is exclusive, of burial (including a 're-claimed burial plot' (see DMG, volume 7, chapter 39) and the cost of burial in Area 1 is £275
the cost of burial in Area 2, where Mr A already holds rights to a shared plot, is £215
The DM can award the £60 transport costs over 50 miles because £60 plus £215 = £275, which is no more than would have been awarded if the cost of the plot with exclusive right of burial plus burial costs (including a 're-claimed burial plot' (see DMG, volume 7, chapter 39) had been met for Mr A in Area 1.

The Decision Maker (DM) can still consider additional costs, which are not included in the list of specified expenses as relating to the funeral. These can be paid as other funeral expenses although they are subject to a capping limit.
There is no definition of 'other funeral expenses'. The DM decides whether something can be awarded as a funeral expense. For further information, see DMG Volume 7 Chapter 39 Any other funeral expenses.
Prioritise other FEP additional costs then consider costs that could be covered by the Children's Funeral Fund.
It is not necessary to decide if these amounts are reasonable or necessary but the total amount awarded is subject to the capping limit.
Capping limits
Capping limits are the maximum amount that can be awarded to a claimant to pay for other funeral expenses, that is, expenses not considered as specified funeral expenses.
The capped amounts available to the claimant can be used to pay for any items and services of their choosing provided that the item or service is accepted as a funeral expense.
The capping limits are:
£120 – where a pre-paid funeral plan exists
£700 - where the deceased died on or before 7 April 2020 and a pre-paid funeral plan does not exist
£1000 - where the deceased died on or after 8 April 2020 and a pre-paid funeral plan does not exist
Sometimes, the deceased may have a pre-paid funeral plan that has only been partially paid for. In these cases, the funeral plan is cancelled and any money paid towards the funeral plan is usually refunded.
Because the funeral plan has been cancelled, and a pre-paid plan no longer exists, the higher capping limit applies but any refunds from cancelled funeral plans are treated in the same way as any other resource.
For further information how to apply capping limits only after taking any discounts into account, see: Funeral discounts.
For further information, see: DMG Volume 7, Chapter 39, Specific items and services for burial and cremation.

Although some Funeral Directors offer discounts for early payment of bills, they may also impose a surcharge for late payment of the bill.
Surcharges are not allowable as specified funeral expenses because they are considered a business charge. They can however, be included in an award if the DM considers them as other funeral expenses.

A Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) cannot be made unless one of the following documents has been seen and examined:
the Funeral Director's final bill, or
a signed contract between the Funeral Director and the responsible person.
A signed contract is a formal written agreement between both parties, that is, the Funeral Director and the responsible person, which outlines the services, and items the Funeral Director has agreed to provide and the price to be paid by the responsible person for those services or items.
The signed contract or final bill must contain a breakdown of the cost of the specified expenses, but the other expenses need not be itemised.
A FEP award cannot be based on an estimate. Estimates serve no purpose for the Funeral Payments scheme. The final bill or signed contract must be obtained if not already submitted earlier.
A FEP can be made in advance of the funeral, for further information see: Advance claims. An itemised written signed contract from the Funeral Director is required. An estimate is not acceptable and must not be used.
From 2 April 2018, evidence for a funeral payment could be made electronically.

The claimant is still entitled to claim a FEP even if the claimant has paid the bill. The claimant might have paid the bill from their own savings or borrowed money to pay the bill.
The fully itemised final bill or signed contract is however, still required as evidence to support the claim.

If the decision maker receives a signed contract between the funeral director and the responsible person before the funeral, a test for eligibility can take place straight away instead of waiting for the final bill or invoice.
Before making a decision on a FEP, request the fully itemised signed contract or final bill from the Funeral Director if not already received, but allow for Funeral Directors who may not issue this for some time.
If a signed copy of a contract is received there is no need to contact the claimant as it is clear that the claimant accepts it as properly reflecting the services provided. If an unsigned contract is received, contact the claimant and advise them that they or the funeral director will need to send a signed copy.
Once received, scan a copy of the bill or signed contract and upload to DRS. Return the original to the claimant.

When a person dies in prison custody, the Prison Service (PS) may contribute towards funeral expenses.  This is paid directly to the Funeral Director (FD).
The PS will consider whether a Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) is due before they pay.  If there is entitlement to a FEP they will not make a payment to the FD.
If the PS consider that a FEP is not due they may contribute to the funeral expenses making payment direct to the FD.  You must check the funeral bill to identify if there any items that have already been paid for by the PS.  Do not contact the PS to check this.
In cases where the Prison Service make a payment prior to the FEP claim, items that they have not paid for can be claimed by the FEP customer.
If the customer is claiming for some or all of the items that have already been paid for by the Prison service, please refer the case to DMA Leeds for advice.

Some Funeral Directors offer a discount for early payment of the funeral bill. This may be offered in the form of:
a percentage of the bill, or
a set amount.
The discount may relate to:
the total bill, or
a specific part of the bill.
A discount must be deducted from a Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) award if the award will be made in sufficient time to allow the claimant to pay the funeral bill within the specified time limits to obtain the discount.
If a discount is to be deducted from the FEP claim it must be applied to the items or services that the discount is offered on and are included in the Funeral Director's bill.
To give the claimant the maximum benefit of any discounts subject to the guidance in Calculating and applying discounts, the capping limits applicable to other funeral expenses are only applied after any discount has been deducted.
Calculating and applying discounts
If a claimant sends in a final fully itemised Funeral Director's bill to support their claim, and a discount is available and appropriate, the award must be for the total allowable amount on the biII, less the discount.
Any discount must be calculated and applied clerically.
Do not use the 'discount' screen in the Social Fund Computer System (SFCS).
Discounts are applied equally to each component of the bill, that is, on a pro-rata basis. This is to ensure that even if only some of the costs claimed are awarded, the appropriate proportion of discount is still applied.
To calculate and apply discounts, take the following action:
Establish which costs are for specified funeral expenses and which are other funeral expenses.
Establish the amount of discount available, and apply this on a pro-rata basis to each component of the bill, as follows:
if the discount is offered as a per cent of the whole bill, for example ten per cent, then apply ten per cent discount to each component of the bill
if a fixed amount has been offered, such as £200 off the total bill:
calculate the per cent this represents, i.e. divide the discount by the total bill then multiply by 100, and
use this percentage discount for each component of the bill.

To calculate the total allowable amount for a FEP award, take the following action:
Add:
the amount of specified funeral expenses allowed as reasonable or necessary, to
the lower of either:
total amount of other funeral expenses, or
capping limit amount.
Consider any deductions from the award for Savings, resources, assets and lump sums.
For clerical cases, the award is calculated by using and completing form SF204. For further details go to Making Clerical Payments and view paragraphs 100 onwards.
For SFCS cases however, the award is generated automatically once the details have been recorded on the system when the claim is processed.

Example A
In this example, the funeral bill is for a total of £1400 but a ten per cent discount is available if the bill is paid promptly. It can be seen that:
the ten per cent discount has been applied accordingly
all of the specified funeral expenses have been deemed reasonable and allowed
there is no pre-paid funeral plan so the applicable capping limit for other funeral expenses is £700
the cap applied has not been reached so the entire bill, less the discount available, is awarded.
Example B
Example A The funeral bill totals £1450 but a discount of £200 is available if the bill is paid promptly. It can be seen that:
the discount of £200 represented 13.793% of the total bill so this was the per cent of discount applied to each component
only part of the specified funeral expenses on the bill were deemed reasonable, items totalling £100, before discount, were disallowed
there is no pre-paid funeral plan so the applicable capping limit for other funeral expenses is £700
the cap applied, to other funeral expenses, has not been reached so the £100 that was disallowed, as specified expenses, can be added back into other funeral expenses and included in the award
the entire amount claimed is awarded.
Example C
In this example, the funeral bill totals £1300 but a ten per cent discount is available if the bill is paid promptly. It can be seen that:
the ten per cent discount has been applied accordingly
a pre-paid funeral plan exists which covers all of the specified funeral expenses – this means that all of these expenses have been disallowed
only other funeral expenses can now be considered
the appropriate capping limit for the other funeral expenses is £120 because of the pre-paid funeral plan
the award is limited to the capped amount.

In order to be awarded a funeral payment, the claimant must be the person responsible for organising the funeral of the deceased. The responsible person is not entitled to a funeral payment where the deceased has an immediate family member who is not in receipt of a qualifying benefit and was not estranged from the deceased at the date of death.
From 2 April 2018, a resident of a care establishment (as defined in DMG) whose expenses are met wholly or in part by a local authority are added to the list of persons who are not taken into account in determining whether a claimant is responsible for the funeral cost.

From 2 April 2018, contributions from charities, friends, and relatives towards the funeral cost were allowed, and these were not deducted from the funeral payment.
From 31 January 2025, they should only be disregarded if they are paid directly to the claimant. This is treated as the claimant's own capital and should therefore be disregarded.
In this context a charity is a contribution not derived from the estate of the deceased.
Charitable donations paid directly to a funeral service provider for example, a funeral director or florist, reduces the total cost of the funeral which the claimant is responsible for.
A donation paid directly to a third party service provider, for any costs not included on the funeral bill, would be deducted from those costs. This would be shown on the Social Fund Funeral Payment report and decision form (SF204) and Social Fund Computer System (SFCS).
Example:
claimant claimed £500 for funeral flowers
£200 given directly to the florist by a family member
total amount claimed = £500 less £200
Any donation paid to the funeral director, would be deducted from the total bill (in the same way as a non-specific insurance policy would be), rather than every element of the bill.
If any contribution is paid direct to the funeral director, it should first be deducted from the non-specified costs on the funeral bill. For example, funeral director fees, coffin, cars, order of service, then deduct the sum from that total on form SF204. If that still leaves other costs totalling £1000 or more, then pay the £1000 cap.
If the donation paid direct to funeral director leaves the remaining other expenses or non-specified costs at less than £1000, pay the adjusted cap.
If the contribution paid to the funeral director ‘nilled’ the cap of £1000, then anything more than that amount would need to be deducted from the specified costs next (burial or cremation fee).
Example:
total bill = £5000
donation paid direct to funeral director = £4000
non-specified costs on the bill = £3500
specified costs for burial = £1500
Apply the £4000 donation to the non-specified costs first, the costs would be ‘nilled’ (£0).
record on the SF204 form and SFCS as £3500 less £3500 adjustment = nil (£0)
the remaining £500 donation, not yet accounted for, would be deducted from the specified costs
record as specified costs, £1500 less adjustment of £500, leaving £1000 payable
consider the remaining £300 which the claimant is responsible for, under other unspecified costs
A Funeral Expense Payment (FEP) will be paid up to a maximum of the balance of the remaining funeral bill after any such donation has been deducted, or the FEP eligibility limit, whichever is lower.
Trust payments
Some government funded trusts make payments to people infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from National Health Service (NHS) blood and tissue supplies and to infected partners and children.
Do not take account of any savings of the deceased that consist solely of Trust payments from any of the following:
Macfarlane Trust
Macfarlane Special Payments Trust
Macfarlane Special Payments Trust (no 2)
The Fund
The Skipton Fund
The EiIeen Trust
Department of Health Payments in Respect of Victims of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
The London Bombings Relief Charitable Fund
The MFET Limited
The Independent Living Fund 2006 is not considered to be such a Trust.
Beneficiaries of Trust payments are advised to keep Trust payments separate from other capital. In cases where Trust payments have been joint with other capital, but establish exactly how much was from the Trust and disregard this amount.
Currently guidance advises that payments from specified trusts are disregarded from any deduction made under the regulations, learn more about Deductions 39371 - 39699
From 2 April 2018 this provision is removed as the provision to deduct a contribution from a charity (friend or relative) is also removed.
War Pensioner's Funeral Grant
A War Pensioner's Funeral Grant (WPFG) is payable if:
a pensioner dies from a disablement for which they received their pension
the pensioner was in receipt of Constant Attendance Allowance (CAA) for their disablement
Take any WPFG fully into account against any FEP payable.
If a claimant declares that a claim for WPFG has been made but not yet paid, take the following action:
Quote the War Pension number in full and send it to the Veterans Agency (VA), when completing the form SF214. This form can be found in the Customer Content Portal
Set a case control for 14 days for a reply, if appropriate.
If a reply has not been received by the case control date, telephone the Service Personnel and Veterans UK. Ask them to send the tear-off from form SF214 in confirmation of the outcome of the claim.
If the FEP is needed urgently, do not wait for Veterans UK to decide the claim before making the FEP. Veterans UK will notify offices on form MPA108 of the result of all claims for WPFG.

Pre-paid funeral plans
In some cases, a pre-paid funeral plan or similar arrangement may have been arranged to cover some or all of the funeral expenses.
If the plan has been fully paid for, the nominated Funeral Director will carry out the funeral as specified, on the death of the person covered by the plan.
FEP claims for items or services should be:
disallowed:
if the cost of those items or services are fully covered by the plan
the cost of those items or services are not covered by the plan but are allowable specified funeral expenses or
only some of the cost of those items or services is covered by the plan but the additional cost is considered reasonable and necessary – for example, a plan may cover £250 towards the cost of a cremation but the reasonable and necessary cost exceeds this. in this case award the balance
allowed if:
If a balance is to be awarded, treat the plan provision as a resource and deduct it from the award. If however, the plan fully covers the funeral costs, disallow the costs by using decision code [68] in SFCS Dialogue SF183 Record or amend funeral payment decision screen SF183227 Consider Funeral Expenses.
Plan not fully paid up
A pre-paid funeral plan may have been paid for by instalments but sometimes a person may die before they have made the final payment.
When this happens, the plan may be cancelled and the payments made may be refunded. In this case, treat any refund as savings and resources and deduct from the award.
For confirmation of the circumstances, ask the claimant to provide a copy of:
the original funeral plan
the Funeral Director’s account, and
any letters from the Funeral Director which detail any discrepancies and or refunds.

For Social Fund (SF) purposes, Legal Personal Representative (LPR) means an executor, administrator or person handling the estate, as appropriate.
A claim for a Funeral Expenses Payment (FEP) cannot be processed until details of the LPR are provided. This is because the Social Fund Computer System (SFCS) will inform the LPR of the award so that recovery can be arranged. For further information, see: Funeral Recoveries.
The LPR may employ a solicitor and/or other agent to act on their behalf. If there is more than one LPR, contact each one to find out who wishes to receive the letters about FEP repayment.
If an LPR is not input, the recovery letters will go to the person who claimed the FEP.
If the claimant is the LPR, note this fact on the claim documents.
The LPR details cannot be amended once a decision that resulted in an award has been made
Recording LPR details
To record the details, take the following action:
Access Dialogue SF050 record or amend funeral payment claim.
Access screen SF050055 record LPR or Corporate LPR details.
Using the details in part 7 of the SF200 claim form, complete the relevant fields. This screen must not be used if the LPR is the claimant or their partner.
Select F1 to update the claim and then record the decision.
