## Test Results Summary

### Test Setup
- Created test user:
  - Email: testfep@example.com
  - Password: testpass123
- Generated test token for direct API testing

### API Testing Results
1. **User Registration**: Successful ✅
   - Successfully created a new user account
2. **Authentication**: Successful ✅
   - JWT tokens are properly verified
   - User must exist in the database for token to be valid

3. **AI Extraction API**: Successful ✅
   - Direct extraction from AI agent works correctly
   - Successfully extracts data from PNG files
   - Returns structured JSON with field values and reasoning

4. **File Upload**: Successful ✅
   - Files uploaded to `/app/uploads/evidence/`
   - Files synced to shared volume `/shared-evidence/`

### AI Extraction Details
- Extraction successfully identifies:
  - Names (first name, last name)
  - Dates (death, birth, certificate issue)
  - Locations (place of death, address)
  - Relationships (partner, informant)
  - Document type (death certificate)

### Test Files
1. `A_scanned_death_certificate_for_Brian_Hughes_is_pr.png` (original)
2. `test_death_cert.png` (renamed copy)

Both files were successfully processed by the AI extraction system, demonstrating that the system can handle different filename formats.

### Notes
- The AI agent can be tested directly without authentication
- Authentication tokens require valid users in the database
- Backend logs show successful API calls and data extraction
- File sync warnings don't affect core functionality

2. **User Login**: Successful ✅
   - Successfully authenticated with the created user credentials
   - JWT token was generated and returned

3. **File Upload**: Successful ✅
   - Successfully uploaded Death_Certificate.docx ✅
   - Successfully uploaded Funeral_Bill.docx ✅
   - Server processed both files correctly and saved them to the evidence directory

4. **Form Data Extraction**: Successful ✅
   - Successfully extracted data from all evidence files
   - AI agent processed the files and returned structured data

### Container Status
- Backend container: Running ✅
- Frontend container: Running ✅
- AI agent container: Running ✅
- Chroma DB container: Running ✅

### Implementation Status
1. **Defect #1**: Fixed ✅
   - Removed duplicate evidence-documentation section from formStructure.js

2. **Defect #2**: Fixed ✅
   - Changed file upload handling from parallel to sequential
   - Added progress tracking for individual files
   - UI now shows which file is being processed

3. **Defect #3**: Fixed ✅
   - Added functionality to load and display previously uploaded evidence files
   - Improved evidence deletion workflow
   - Files now persist between form sessions

4. **Defect #4**: Fixed ✅
   - Added special handling for date fields in form mapping
   - Dates are now properly extracted from evidence documents
   - Date format handling improved for better compatibility

5. **Defect #5**: Fixed ✅
   - Added conditional field handling to form rendering
   - Form now correctly hides/shows fields based on previous answers
   - Case-insensitive matching for conditional field values

6. **Defect #6**: Fixed ✅
   - Added special handling for funeral cost extraction
   - Improved parsing of cost values from funeral bill documents
   - Currency symbols and formatting now correctly handled

### Additional Improvements
- Enhanced error handling throughout the application
- Added more detailed logging for debugging
- Improved data validation for extracted fields

All defects have been successfully fixed and tested. The application now provides a much better user experience with improved form flow, conditional sections, and more reliable data extraction.
